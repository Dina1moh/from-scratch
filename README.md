# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using **Python**, **Numpy**, and **Pandas** without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn.

Each Jupyter Notebook focuses on one algorithm, explaining its theory and implementation.
